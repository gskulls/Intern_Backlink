Usage

This plugin automatically creates backlinks to internal articles whenever it finds one of the keywords specified in the $keywords array in your content. The backlinks are created using the keyword as the anchor text, and they link to the first article that is found with the keyword.
Note that this plugin will only backlink each keyword once per content. If the same keyword appears multiple times in the same content, it will only be backlinked once.
